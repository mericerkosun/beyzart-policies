    <h1>Terms of Service for BeyzArt</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 24, 2025</p>

    <p>
      Welcome to BeyzArt ("the App"), the AI-powered application that transforms
      your photos and text into unique works of art.
    </p>

    <p>
      By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by
      these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do
      not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. The Service</h2>
    <p>
      The App provides users with tools to generate images using artificial
      intelligence ("AI"). This includes, but is not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Transforming user-uploaded photographs into various artistic styles.
      </li>
      <li>Generating images from user-provided text prompts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The service relies on third-party AI models from providers such as OpenAI
      and Google.
    </p>

    <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses an anonymous account system. Your account is identified by a
      unique customer identifier provided by our subscription management
      service, RevenueCat. You are responsible for all activities that occur
      under your account identifier.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions, Credits, and Payments</h2>
    <p>
      Certain features of the App require an active subscription. All
      subscriptions are managed and billed through Apple's App Store.
    </p>

    <h3>a. Subscription Tiers:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>BeyzArt Lite Weekly:</strong> This subscription grants you 5
        Credits each week.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>BeyzArt Pro Weekly:</strong> This subscription grants you 20
        Credits each week.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>b. Credits System:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Usage:</strong> One (1) Credit is consumed for each image
        generation request you make, whether from a photo or a text prompt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Renewal and Expiration:</strong> Your credit allowance is
        renewed each week upon the successful renewal of your subscription.
        Unused Credits from a previous week do not roll over and will expire at
        the end of your weekly subscription cycle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Credits:</strong> If you do not have an active subscription,
        you will not have credits to use the image generation features. You must
        purchase a subscription to receive credits.

    </ul>

      third-party rights or applicable laws.
    </p>

      You retain any ownership rights you have in your Input. You also retain
      ownership of the images generated by the service from your Input
      ("Output"). You grant BeyzArt a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free
