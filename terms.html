    <h1>Terms of Service for BeyzArt</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 24, 2025</p>

    <p>
      Welcome to BeyzArt! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of
      the BeyzArt mobile application (the "Service") provided by BeyzArt ("we,"
      "us," or "our"). By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound
      by these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By using BeyzArt, you confirm that you are at least 13 years of age and
      agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>
      BeyzArt allows you to transform your photos and generate images from text
      prompts using artificial intelligence. You are responsible for your use of
      the Service and for any content you provide, including compliance with
      applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
    <p>
      BeyzArt uses an anonymous user identification system managed by
      RevenueCat. We do not require you to create a traditional account with a
      username and password. Your purchase history and subscription status are
      linked to an anonymous ID.
    </p>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is based on a credit system. You need credits to generate or
      transform images. Credits are provided through weekly subscriptions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Subscription Tiers:</strong> We offer multiple subscription
        tiers, including but not limited to:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lite Weekly:</strong> Provides 5 credits per week.</li>
          <li><strong>Pro Weekly:</strong> Provides 20 credits per week.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Billing:</strong> Subscriptions are managed through the Apple
        App Store and will automatically renew each week unless you cancel at
        least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Credit Usage:</strong> One credit is consumed for each image
        generation. Unused credits expire at the end of the weekly period and do
        not roll over.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for the images you upload and the text prompts
      you provide ("Input Content"), as well as the images generated by the
      Service ("Output Content").
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Ownership:</strong> You retain ownership of your Input Content.
        You own the Output Content generated from your inputs, subject to the
        terms of our third-party AI service providers (OpenAI and Google).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prohibited Content:</strong> You agree not to create any content
        that is illegal, harmful, abusive, infringing, defamatory, or that
        violates the content policies of our AI service providers. We reserve
        the right to terminate your access for creating such content.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Privacy of Your Content</h2>
    <p>We prioritize your privacy.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>We cannot see your images:</strong> We do not have the ability
        to view, access, or store the images you upload or the images generated
        by the AI. The entire process is automated and private.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your gallery of created images is stored
        locally on your device and is not uploaded to our servers.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately,
      without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including
      without limitation if you breach these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We do not
      warrant that the results generated by the Service will meet your
      requirements or be accurate, reliable, or free of errors.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      In no event shall BeyzArt, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents,
      suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
      consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of
      profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from
      your use of the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will
      provide notice of any changes by posting the new Terms of Service within
      the app.
