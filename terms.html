      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 27, 2025</p>

      <div class="section">
        <p>
          Welcome to BeyzArt! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use
          of our iOS application ("App") and the services provided therein. By
          accessing or using our App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>1. The Service</h2>
        <p>
          BeyzArt ("we", "us", "our") provides a service that allows users to
          transform their photos and text prompts into artistic images using
          artificial intelligence ("Service"). The Service is available to users
          who subscribe to one of our available plans.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Subscriptions & Credits</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Subscription Requirement:</strong> Access to the image
            generation features of the Service requires an active, auto-renewing
            subscription.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Subscription Plans:</strong> We offer various subscription
            plans, such as "Weekly" and "Annual". Each plan comes with a
            specific number of image generation credits ("Credits") that are
            allocated at the beginning of each billing cycle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Credit Allocation:</strong> The Weekly Plan grants 30
            Credits per 7-day period. The Annual Plan grants 300 Credits per
            365-day period.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Credit Usage:</strong> Each image generation consumes one
            (1) Credit. Unused Credits <strong>do not roll over</strong> to the
            next billing period.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Billing:</strong> Subscriptions are managed exclusively
            through Apple's In-App Purchase system. Your Apple Account will be
            charged at the confirmation of purchase and at the beginning of each
            renewal period. You can manage or cancel your subscription at any
            time through your device's Account Settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Introductory Offers:</strong> We may offer special
            introductory prices, such as a discounted first week. These offers
            are available only once to new, eligible users. After the
            introductory period, the subscription will automatically renew at
            the standard price unless canceled.
