    <h1>Privacy Policy for BeyzArt</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 24, 2025</p>

    <p>
      BeyzArt ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy.
      This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with
      your use of the BeyzArt mobile application (the "Service").
    </p>

    <p>
      By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information
      in accordance with this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We design our Service to be as private as possible.</p>

    <h3>Information We Do Collect:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Anonymous User ID:</strong> We use services from RevenueCat to
        manage subscriptions. RevenueCat assigns a randomized, anonymous
        identifier to you. This ID is not linked to your personal identity and
        is used solely to manage your subscription status and credit balance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect basic, non-identifying
        device information (e.g., device model, OS version) for analytics and to
        improve our Service. This is collected via our backend service
        (Supabase) and is tied to your anonymous ID.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Transaction Information:</strong> Purchase and subscription
        events are processed by RevenueCat and the Apple App Store. We receive
        anonymous transaction data (like subscription tier and renewal dates) to
        provide you with the services you've purchased. We do not see or store
        your payment information.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information We DO NOT Collect:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not ask for, collect, or
        store any personally identifiable information such as your name, email
        address, or phone number.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Your Photos and Generated Images:</strong>
        <em
          >We cannot see, access, or store your photos or the images you
          generate.</em
        >
        When you upload a photo or provide a text prompt, it is sent directly to
        our third-party AI service providers (OpenAI and Google) for processing.
        The resulting image is sent back directly to your device. Your gallery
        of created images is stored only on your device.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the limited, anonymous information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate, and maintain our Service.</li>
      <li>Manage your subscription and credit balance.</li>
      <li>Improve the Service and troubleshoot issues.</li>
      <li>Monitor for compliance with our Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We rely on trusted third-party services to provide our core functionality.
      These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to
      review them:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Apple App Store:</strong> Manages all payments and
        subscriptions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Manages subscription status and anonymous
        user IDs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Supabase:</strong> Our backend provider for managing anonymous
        user data (like credit balance) and proxying requests to AI services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>OpenAI & Google (Gemini/Imagen):</strong> The AI services that
        process your images and text prompts. They do not retain your data
        long-term and use it only to provide the service. Please refer to their
        respective privacy policies for details.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use Supabase for our backend, which employs industry-standard security
      measures to protect the anonymous data we store. Since we do not collect
      personal information or your images, the risk of a personal data breach is
      significantly minimized.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. This
      is to comply with the terms of our third-party AI providers and with
      regulations like the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We
      do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app.
    </p>
